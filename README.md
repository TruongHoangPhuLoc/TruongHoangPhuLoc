Iâ€™m currently learning:
 + ðŸŒ± Kubernetes-related topics
 + ðŸŒ± Unix/Linux
 + ðŸŒ± Provisioning and Automation
 + ðŸŒ± Building my own homelab for self-learning purpose 

Fun facts:
 + ðŸ˜† Linux/Unix become my mainly focused subject at university as I wasn't able to afford license of Windows or anything relating to exclusive stuff :D
 + ðŸ˜† My name is Loc and it has "fortunate and lucky" meaning in my country
