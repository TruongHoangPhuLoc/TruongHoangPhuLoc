🔭 I’m currently working on Operation field, as a Linux/Unix administrator

I’m currently learning:
 + 🌱 Kubernetes-related topics
 + 🌱 Unix/Linux
 + 🌱 Provisioning and Automation
 + 🌱 Building my own homelab for self-learning purpose 

Fun facts:
 + 😆 Linux/Unix become my mainly focused subject at university as I wasn't able to afford license of Windows or anything relating to exclusive stuff :D
 + 😆 My name is Loc and it has "fortunate and lucky" meaning in my country 


 🤔 I’m looking for help with developing skills, I think it'd be better for me for building up myself towards completetion

 
 👯 Please feel free to get in touch with me, I'm very grateful and delighted to be able to exchange knowledge from each other
