ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Operation field, as a Linux/Unix administrator

Iâ€™m currently learning:
 + ðŸŒ± Kubernetes-related topics
 + ðŸŒ± Unix/Linux
 + ðŸŒ± Provisioning and Automation
 + ðŸŒ± Building my own homelab for self-learning purpose 

Fun facts:
 + ðŸ˜† Linux/Unix become my mainly focused subject at university as I wasn't able to afford license of Windows or anything relating to exclusive stuff :D
 + ðŸ˜† My name is Loc and it has "fortunate and lucky" meaning in my country 


 ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with developing skills, I think it'd be better for me for building up myself towards completetion

 
 ðŸ‘¯ Please feel free to get in touch with me, I'm very grateful and delighted to be able to exchange knowledge from each other
